# SLAM_Testing
Testing Records of Monocular DSO &amp; Stereo ORB_SLAM on Mall Data Set 

1. Background
ORB_SLAM and DSO have become most popular SLAM algorithms in ａｃａｄｅｍｉａ. For the purpose of exploring a more effective SLAM-BASED way of real-time 3D reconsturction of our own Mall image data set (taken in Providence Place, RI), first we need to test the novel algorithms and see how well they perform.
