# SLAM_Testing
Testing Records of Monocular DSO &amp; Stereo ORB_SLAM on Different Data Set 

1. Background
ORB_SLAM and DSO have become most popular SLAM algorithms in ａｃａｄｅｍｉａ. For the purpose of exploring a more effective SLAM-BASED way of real-time 3D reconsturction based on 2D image sequences, first we need to test the novel algorithms and see how well they perform.

2. Testing Data Source
Testing data includes:
    Stereo Mall data set (photographs taken in Providence Place, RI) 
    Stereo Pavilion data set (generated using Blender)
    P.S. All data sets above obviously can be used as monocular as well if needed.
    
3. Blahhhh Diary
In fact, the hardest procedure is always setting up the testing ｅｎvironment on my Ubuntu 14.04 and dealing with all kinds of unmatching package version problems :-) 

I have used many useful tools during those process such as Python Scripting in Blender, Matlab, etc. Some of those scripts and their usage can be found in other folders of this repository.
